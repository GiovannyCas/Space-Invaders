# Space Invaders

I developed a Space Invaders Clone, a retro-inspired space shooter game, using C++ and the SFML library. This project combines classic arcade gameplay with modern development techniques to create a compelling gaming experience.

Project Highlights:

Retro Arcade Experience: emulates the classic Space Invaders gameplay, featuring engaging, fast-paced action that challenges players to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders.

C++ and SFML: Leveraging the power of C++ alongside the SFML library, I ensured robust performance and smooth graphics rendering, delivering a seamless and responsive gaming experience.

Visual and Audio Design: The game features pixel art graphics that evoke the charm of classic arcade games, paired with immersive sound effects to enhance player engagement.

Endless Mode and Leaderboards: An endless mode offers continuous challenges, encouraging players to achieve high scores.
